        <p>It is nearing the end of the year: 2023. With 2023 there came a whole load of memories. But not just memories, but also
        Video Games! There have been a lot of video games that were released this year. You're probably reading this and wondering:
        "Why am i writing this page when I can go and play these games myself?.

        <p> Playing video games are a huge hobby of mine.
        And now in the year 2023, I believe that a lot of triple A gaming companes, care more about money than they do of making actual functioning and fun games.
        I don't want people to buy a game based on hype and popular opinion, I want people to actually play a game that they will enjoy it. 
        Rather than buy a game,  based on hype, and ending up wasting like 60 bucks!
        I'm going to write about 2 video games which i personally played, these truly stood out to me this year. Ones that really, REALLY blew my mind. And I truly enjoyed
        the moments when I played them.
