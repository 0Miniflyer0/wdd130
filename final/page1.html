        <p>My first place pick for the best game of 2023 goes to Baldur's Gate 3, the third installment of the Baldur's Gate Series. I personally have not played Baldur's Gate 1 or 2 before playing Baldur's Gate 3, but I have a friend who has, and they really liked it. I was not playing the game just because my friend had played it; I wanted to play it because it was developed by Larian Studios, the creators of Divinity Original Sin 2.
        As opposed to Bioware, the creators of Baldur's Gate 1 and 2. Divinity Original Sin was another excellent game that the same friend suggested to me, and that I played through multiple times. When I heard that Baldur's Gate 3 was being developed by the same studio, I was curious. It was in Early Access for 3 years, and I never did any research on it, but my cousin suggested I should play. Baldur's Gate 3 fully released on August 3, 2023, and it blew my mind in nearly every aspect - the story, the music, the emotion, and the gameplay. It's an excellent CRPG (Computer Role-Playing Game).</p>

        <p>At first, I didn't think much of it because I had no idea how DND worked, as I had never played DND. However, after starting to play with my friend, who taught me everything, I really started to enjoy it a lot. There were many weeks and even months where I got up and got right to playing. I loved every moment; the gameplay was immensely fun once I knew how it worked. The music was wonderful, and I still listen to it to this day. The roleplaying really made the characters feel alive, and it even made me feel like my character I made was actually alive.
        The emotion I felt was so good when I played the game too. The emotion was immensely powerful, with several moments where my heartstrings were pulled, and even times where I felt bad for my actions in the game. There was even a moment where I cried. That's just how immersed I felt when I was playing the game. Your companions actually felt like they were really there, and really your friends. All in all, Baldur's Gate 3 is a fantastic game; it absolutely blew my mind when I finished it, and I was sad when it was done. But I also played it several more times. This game will be my personal pick of 2023. There is a lot of love that was put into this game. In fact, there are a multitude of references to BG1 and 2 for those who had played the originals. I highly suggest it to anyone who likes games like DND. And bring some friends; it's also way more fun with friends.</p>
