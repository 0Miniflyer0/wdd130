        <p>My first place pick of the best game of 2023, Goes to: Baldur's Gate 3.
        The third installment of the Baldur's Gate Series. 
        I personally have not played Baldur's Gate 1 or 2, before playing Baldur's Gate 3, But I have a friend who has, and they
        really liked it. I was not playing the game just because my friend had played it so I thought "Oh, so it must be good."
        But I wanted to play it because it was Developed my Larian Studios, The Creators Of Divinity Original Sin 2.
        As opposed to Bioware, the Creators Of Baldur's Gate 1 and 2. But Divinity Original Sin, was
        Another excellent game that the same friend suggested to me, And that I played thorugh multiple times.
        So when I heard that Baldur's Gate 3 was being developed by the same studio, I was curious, It was in Early Access for 3 years.
        I never did any research to it, but my cousin suggested I Should play. But I waited and Did no research on it. 
        Then Baldur's Gate 3 fully released on: August 3, 2023. And It blew my mind, in near every aspect.
        The Story, The Music, The Emotion. The Gameplay It's an Excellent CRPG (Computer roleplaying Game.)
