        <p>My first place pick of the best game of 2023, Goes to: Baldur's Gate 3.
        The third installment of the Baldur's Gate Series. 
        I personally have not played Baldur's Gate 1 or 2, before playing Baldur's Gate 3, But I have a friend who has, and they
        really liked it. I was not playing the game just because my friend had played it so I thought "Oh, so it must be good."
        But I wanted to play it because it was Developed my Larian Studios, The Creators Of Divinity Original Sin 2.
        As opposed to Bioware, the Creators Of Baldur's Gate 1 and 2. But Divinity Original Sin, was
        Another excellent game that the same friend suggested to me, And that I played thorugh multiple times.
        So when I heard that Baldur's Gate 3 was being developed by the same studio, I was curious, It was in Early Access for 3 years.
        I never did any research to it, but my cousin suggested I Should play. But I waited and Did no research on it. 
        Then Baldur's Gate 3 fully released on: August 3, 2023. And It blew my mind, in near every aspect.
        The Story, The Music, The Emotion. The Gameplay It's an Excellent CRPG (Computer roleplaying Game.)

    <p>At first I didn't think much of it, cause I had no Idea how DND worked, cause I never played DND, so I thought it average. 
        But after i started to play with my friend, who taught me everything. I really started to Enjoy it a lot, there were many weeks
        and even months, where I got up and got right to playing. I loved every moment, the gameplay was immensely fun once i knew how it worked.
        The music was wonderful, I still listen to the music to this day. The roleplaying really made the characters feel alive, and it 
        even made me feel like my character i made was actually alive. The Emotion I felt was so good when I played the game too. 
        The emotion was immensely powerful, that there were several moments where my heartstrings were pulled, and even times where
        i felt bad for my actions in game. And there was even a moment where I cried. That's just how immeresed I felt when I was playing then game.
        Your companions actually felt like they were really there, and really your friends. 
        All in all, Baldur's Gate 3 Is a Fantastic game, It absolutely blew my mind when I actually finished it. And I was sad when it was done. 
        But i also played it several more times. And so this game will be my personal Pick of 2023.There is A LOT of Love that was put into this game.
        In fact there are a Multitdue of References to BG1 And 2, for those who had played the Originals.
        And I highly suggest it to anyone who likes games like DND. And bring some friends, it's also way more fun with friends.
