        <p>Resident Evil 4 Remake, a remake of a Cult Classic, and One of the best Games in the Resident Evil Franchise. 
        Resident Evil 4.
        Before Resident Evil 4 Remake Came out, I did play the Demo. And It was Really fun.
        I was also reading comments on youtube, reddit, and so on. And I kept seeing comments saying things like:
        "The remake won't be as a good as the orignal." But in this day and age, Capcom was still one of the few triple A Gaming Companies
        Who actually still put in effort with their games.

    <p>Then March 24, 2023. Resident Evil 4 Remake Released. And it was amazing. Aside from the obvious changes from the Original.
        Like removing of certain jokes that are inappropriate for the year 2023, but were fine in 2004. Graphical changes. 
        Real-time weapon switching. The game is Amazing loyal to the original, in terms of the story, plot and mostly gameplay.
        You can really tell that Capcom put a lot of love in the remake, they wanted to please fans of the origina, and 
        introduce new things. Like side quests. One of my favorite things that was brought into Resident Evil 4 Remake was The Horror Aspect.
        When I played the original Resident Evil 4, There were some parts that tried to be scary. And they just didn't hit me. But in the remake?
        Parts that were intended to be scary, and stressful, actually got me shaking in fear and tensing in my chair.
        I really enjoyed that The remake made 2 bosses that i aboslutely detested in the original, and made them my favorite bosses in the remake.
        And the musical score is fantastic, each area has their respective tracks, and fits in every scenary that it plays in. Especially the boss music.
        You can really tell how much love was put into Resident Evil 4 Remake. With the release of The Seperate Ways DLC. They also added
        Love to that DLC, the Original Seperate ways Campagin was awfully short. But the new one is long enough to be intresting, and not too short.
        If you were Iffy about remakes, which is understandable, Go and give Resident Evil 4 Remake a try. And if you haven't played, the original, Go and play the Original afterwards.
