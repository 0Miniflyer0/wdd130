        <p>Resident Evil 4 Remake, a remake of a Cult Classic and one of the best games in the Resident Evil franchise, Resident Evil 4. Before Resident Evil 4 Remake came out, I played the Demo, and it was really fun. I was also reading comments on YouTube, Reddit, and so on, and I kept seeing comments saying things like: "The remake won't be as good as the original." But in this day and age, Capcom was still one of the few triple-A gaming companies who actually put in effort with their games.</p>

        <p>Then on March 24, 2023, Resident Evil 4 Remake was released, and it was amazing. Aside from the obvious changes from the original, like removing certain jokes that are inappropriate for the year 2023 but were fine in 2004, graphical changes, and real-time weapon switching, the game is amazingly loyal to the original in terms of the story, plot, and mostly gameplay. You can really tell that Capcom put a lot of love into the remake; they wanted to please fans of the original and introduce new things like side quests.
        One of my favorite things brought into Resident Evil 4 Remake was the horror aspect. When I played the original Resident Evil 4, there were some parts that tried to be scary, and they just didn't hit me. But in the remake, parts that were intended to be scary and stressful actually got me shaking in fear and tensing in my chair. I really enjoyed that the remake made two bosses that I absolutely detested in the original my favorite bosses in the remake. The musical score is fantastic; each area has its respective tracks and fits in every scenery that it plays in, especially the boss music. You can really tell how much love was put into Resident Evil 4 Remake.
        With the release of The Separate Ways DLC, they also added love to that DLC. The original Separate Ways Campaign was awfully short, but the new one is long enough to be interesting and not too short. If you were iffy about remakes, which is understandable, go and give Resident Evil 4 Remake a try. And if you haven't played the original, go and play the original afterwards.</p>
