      <h3>Personal Video Game picks of 2023</h3>
      <p>
        It is nearing the end of the year: 2023. With 2023 there came a whole load of memories. But not just memories, but also
        Video Games! There have been a lot of video games that were released this year. You're probably reading this and wondering:
        "Why am i writing this page when I can go and play these games myself?" Well, you see. Playing video games are a huge hobby of mine.
        And now in the year 2023, a lot of triple A gaming companes, care more about money than they do of making actual functioning and fun games.
        I don't want people to buy a game based on hype and popular opinion, I want people to actually play a game that they will enjoy it. 
        Rather than buy a game,  based on hype, and ending up wasting like 60 bucks!
        I'm going to write about 2 video games, that truly stand out this year. Ones that really, REALLY blew my mind. And I truly enjoyed
        the moments when I played them.

      </ul>
      <h3>1st Place: Baldur's Gate 3</h3>
      <p>
        My Number one choice for the best games of 2023 is Baldur's Gate 3. The third installment of the Baldur's Gate Series. 
        I personally have not played Baldur's Gate 1 or 2, before playing Baldur's Gate 3, But I have a friend who has, and they
        really liked it. I was not playing the game just because my friend had played it so I thought "Oh, so it must be good."
        But I wanted to play it because it was Developed my Larian Studios, The Creators Of Divinity Original Sin 2.
        As opposed to Bioware, the Creators Of Baldur's Gate 1 and 2. But Divinity Original Sin, was
        Another excellent game that the same friend suggested to me, And that I played thorugh multiple times.
        So when I heard that Baldur's Gate 3 was being developed by the same studio, I was curious, It was in Early Access for 3 years.
        I never did any research to it, but my cousin suggested I Should play. But I waited and Did no research on it. 
        Then Baldur's Gate 3 fully released on: August 3, 2023. And It blew my mind, in near every aspect.
        The Story, The Music, The Emotion. The Gameplay It's an Excellent CRPG (Computer roleplaying Game.) 
        At first I didn't think much of it, cause I had no Idea how DND worked, cause I never played DND, so I thought it average. 
        But after i started to play with my friend, who taught me everything. I really started to Enjoy it a lot, there were many weeks
        and even months, where I got up and got right to playing. I loved every moment, the gameplay was immensely fun once i knew how it worked.
        The music was wonderful, I still listen to the music to this day. The roleplaying really made the characters feel alive, and it 
        even made me feel like my character i made was actually alive. The Emotion I felt was so good when I played the game too. 
        The emotion was immensely powerful, that there were several moments where my heartstrings were pulled, and even times where
        i felt bad for my actions in game. And there was even a moment where I cried. That's just how immeresed I felt when I was playing then game.
        Your companions actually felt like they were really there, and really your friends. 
        All in all, Baldur's Gate 3 Is a Fantastic game, It absolutely blew my mind when I actually finished it. And I was sad when it was done. 
        But i also played it several more times. And so this game will be my personal Pick of 2023.There is A LOT of Love that was put into this game.
        In fact there are a Multitdue of References to BG1 And 2, for those who had played the Originals.
        And I highly suggest it to anyone who likes games like DND. And bring some friends, it's also way more fun with friends.

      <h3>2nd Place: Resident Evil 4 Remake</h3>
      <p>
        Resident Evil 4 Remake, a remake of a Cult Classic, and One of the best Games in the Resident Evil Franchise. 
        Resident Evil 4.
        Before Resident Evil 4 Remake Came out, I did play the Demo. And It was Really fun.
        I was also reading comments on youtube, reddit, and so on. And I kept seeing comments saying things like:
        "The remake won't be as a good as the orignal." But in this day and age, Capcom was still one of the few triple A Gaming Companies
        Who actually still put in effort with their games. 
        Then March 24, 2023. Resident Evil 4 Remake Released. And it was amazing. Aside from the obvious changes from the Original.
        Like removing of certain jokes that are inappropriate for the year 2023, but were fine in 2004. Graphical changes. 
        Real-time weapon switching. The game is Amazing loyal to the original, in terms of the story, plot and mostly gameplay.
        You can really tell that Capcom put a lot of love in the remake, they wanted to please fans of the origina, and 
        introduce new things. Like side quests. One of my favorite things that was brought into Resident Evil 4 Remake was The Horror Aspect.
        When I played the original Resident Evil 4, There were some parts that tried to be scary. And they just didn't hit me. But in the remake?
        Parts that were intended to be scary, and stressful, actually got me shaking in fear and tensing in my chair.
        I really enjoyed that The remake made 2 bosses that i aboslutely detested in the original, and made them my favorite bosses in the remake.
        And the musical score is fantastic, each area has their respective tracks, and fits in every scenary that it plays in. Especially the boss music.
        You can really tell how much love was put into Resident Evil 4 Remake. With the release of The Seperate Ways DLC. They also added
        Love to that DLC, the Original Seperate ways Campagin was awfully short. But the new one is long enough to be intresting, and not too short.
        If you were Iffy about remakes, which is understandable, Go and give Resident Evil 4 Remake a try. And if you haven't played, the original, Go and play the Original afterwards.
